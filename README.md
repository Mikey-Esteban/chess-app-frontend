## Chess app retrofitted from [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project)

I completed this project as intended, a command line ruby game, and once I started to learn React I figured this project would be a great way to practice uniting a React UI and Javascript OOP.
